# ai_learning#

This project includes some small examples of machine learning and deep learning

## Examples by Models ##

### Machine Translation ###
In the translation directory
* [seq2seq_english_translation]: Traditional machine translation constructs use GRU-AttentionGRU models
* [T2TBaseline]: The tensor2tensor baseline model, which is simple, is going to be able to train machine translation models very quickly
* [tensor2tensor_translation]: the advanced version of the tensor2tensor model, you can define your own problems and use your own vocabulary

### Text Style Transfer ###
In the ctrl-model directory
* [text_style_transfer]: Discriminator supervision for controlled text generation

### NER ###
In the crf and deepnlp directory
* [crf]: this is a simple CRF example for the NER task
* [deepnlp]: three different models are provided to do the NER task

### Toy ###

* [crawler]: Simple crawler making
* [data_process]: Simple vocab making and tfrecord making
